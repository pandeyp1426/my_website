    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Pradeep Pandey, a Computer Science major at the University of Wisconsin-Stout with a concentration in Mobile Application Development. With a solid foundation in programming languages like C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m passionate about creating impactful solutions in the tech industry. My experience includes developing a responsive restaurant website as an academic project, where I implemented features like user-friendly navigation and an online ordering system.

I bring strong technical and problem-solving skills, which I’m eager to further develop through internships and co-op opportunities in the tech industry. My hands-on experience as a Student Manager and Conference Assistant has honed my leadership, time management, and communication abilities, essential for success in dynamic work environments. I am actively involved in volunteer work and leadership roles, such as with the Leo Club of Prayasnagar-Kathmandu, where I organized social initiatives and community service projects.

Driven by curiosity and a commitment to growth, I am continuously expanding my technical expertise, demonstrated by certifications like the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. I look forward to contributing my skills and enthusiasm to innovative projects in the tech field.</p>

            <h3>Chuddrey Web Application</h3>
			<p>The <strong>Chuddrey Restaurant</strong> web application is an interactive online food ordering platform designed to showcase my skills in full-stack web development. Built with a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, this project delivers a seamless user experience, from browsing menu items to placing delivery orders as a part of an academic project.</p>

        <h4>Project Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users can securely sign in or create an account using a registration form. The login and registration system is built with PHP and MySQL, ensuring secure data handling and authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Menu Display:</strong> The application displays a visually engaging food menu, complete with images, prices, and descriptions for each item. Users can select items to add to their cart, making the ordering process intuitive and interactive.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopping Cart and Order Summary:</strong> Selected menu items are added to a cart, where users can review and modify their order. JavaScript enhances interactivity by dynamically updating the cart and providing immediate feedback on user actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Order and Delivery Information:</strong> A detailed form allows users to input delivery information and choose their preferred payment method (MasterCard, Visa, or American Express). All information is processed and stored securely in a MySQL database using PHP and SQL for data management.</li>
            <li><strong>Database-Driven Backend:</strong> The application utilizes a MySQL database with multiple linked tables to store user accounts, menu items, and order details. PHP and SQL queries manage user authentication, data retrieval, and order storage, creating a robust and secure backend.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI design and interactive elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP for server-side processing and SQL for managing database interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL for persistent storage of user, menu, and order data.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Connected to an online MySQL database, using a free hosting service for real-time data management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Project Highlights</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Chuddrey Restaurant</strong> project showcases my ability to build a complete web application with both frontend and backend components. This project demonstrates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Effective use of MySQL for structured data storage and retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic and Interactive Design:</strong> Engaging UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Robust server-side processing with PHP for secure data handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> A simulated online ordering platform that reflects industry-standard practices in web development.</li>
        </ul>
