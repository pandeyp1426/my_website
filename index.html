    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Pradeep Pandey, a Computer Science major at the University of Wisconsin–Stout with a concentration in Mobile Application Development and a strong foundation in full-stack development. Over the past year I’ve gone beyond classroom projects and started building real applications — most notably RankMyStocks, a React + Flask + MySQL web app that combines API integration, UI/UX design, and database management. I’m also part of a collaborative “Exercise Bingo” system that applies gamification to help students stay active, where I contribute to both front-end logic and team coordination.

My current technical skill set includes experience with C++, Python (Flask), Java, JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS/Tailwind, SQL/MySQL, Git/GitHub workflows, Agile development, and Linux-based tooling through VSCode and Ubuntu. I enjoy working with APIs, building responsive UIs, and structuring clean database designs, and I’m always looking for ways to refine performance, usability, and scalability.

Alongside technical development, I bring strong leadership and communication skills from working as a Student Manager and Conference Assistant, roles where I learned how to manage teams, handle real-time problem solving, and maintain reliability in fast-paced environments. Community involvement is also important to me — through the Leo Club of Prayasnagar-Kathmandu and various volunteer initiatives, I’ve helped organize and contribute to service projects that create real social impact.

I’m the type of developer who enjoys learning by building — experimenting with ideas, transforming concepts into working prototypes, and improving through iteration. With a solid math background (Linear Algebra, Calculus I–III, Discrete Math) and an interest in solving real-world problems through technology, I’m now working toward gaining internship or co-op experience where I can continue growing while contributing to meaningful projects.</p>

            <h3>Chuddrey Web Application</h3>
			<p>The <strong>Chuddrey Restaurant</strong> web application is an interactive online food ordering platform designed to showcase my skills in full-stack web development. Built with a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, this project delivers a seamless user experience, from browsing menu items to placing delivery orders as a part of an academic project.</p>

        <h4>Project Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Users can securely sign in or create an account using a registration form. The login and registration system is built with PHP and MySQL, ensuring secure data handling and authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Menu Display:</strong> The application displays a visually engaging food menu, complete with images, prices, and descriptions for each item. Users can select items to add to their cart, making the ordering process intuitive and interactive.</li>
            <li><strong>Shopping Cart and Order Summary:</strong> Selected menu items are added to a cart, where users can review and modify their order. JavaScript enhances interactivity by dynamically updating the cart and providing immediate feedback on user actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Order and Delivery Information:</strong> A detailed form allows users to input delivery information and choose their preferred payment method (MasterCard, Visa, or American Express). All information is processed and stored securely in a MySQL database using PHP and SQL for data management.</li>
            <li><strong>Database-Driven Backend:</strong> The application utilizes a MySQL database with multiple linked tables to store user accounts, menu items, and order details. PHP and SQL queries manage user authentication, data retrieval, and order storage, creating a robust and secure backend.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI design and interactive elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP for server-side processing and SQL for managing database interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL for persistent storage of user, menu, and order data.</li>
            <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Connected to an online MySQL database, using a free hosting service for real-time data management.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Project Highlights</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Chuddrey Restaurant</strong> project showcases my ability to build a complete web application with both frontend and backend components. This project demonstrates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Effective use of MySQL for structured data storage and retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic and Interactive Design:</strong> Engaging UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Robust server-side processing with PHP for secure data handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> A simulated online ordering platform that reflects industry-standard practices in web development.</li>
        </ul>
